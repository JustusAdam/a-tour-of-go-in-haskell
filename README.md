# A Tour of Go in Haskell

[A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) is a famous tutorial of the Go programming language.

This repository attempts to write [Concurrency](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1) section of A Tour of Go in the Haskell progamming language.

Haskell has *lightweight thread* feature as in Go.

So it should be interesting for us to compare concurrent program in Haskell and Go :)
